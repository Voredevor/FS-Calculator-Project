# Welcome to Devor ReadMe Section, Incase you interested in the boring story of how to build a calculator 
# Pardon my pidgins and tautology, its inborn (Abinibi nii)
Well at first I did not know what to do , confused as the brain refused to boot for a while, thoought of designing first befor HTML, like building the foundations then populating each grids or blocks with numbers and making it central 

Then would go on to add a click feature for each of the number, I wan die 
Isrealites Journey, thats what it called 

Thank God for one or two research shaa 

Transformation came, spent more thank a week learning some new fucntions, the button, data-value and how it works 

With the button element, I could create button for each particular character, and then arranged them accordingly for their rows, a new column for another set of buttons. added the data-value to it, as i can just call that in javascript 

# getAttribute the Saviour
The fact that i can get attribute of all data value in the btn class changed everything for me, or else i would have written a code for each number and operators and assigning them to their respective divs 

# TRY CATCH // first time
The whole  Try Catch block thing was due to someones external project that i got a cue from, watching the classes on try catch no really enter head like that 

# Eval the lifesaver 
The Eval function is another lifesaver, if not i would have written a long else if, if else for each parameters as long to return a sum

# Activate Keyboard, 
Event listener made this easy lol, coding be doing the most, mann we just writing, these things are there if you know how to write it lol 

# Prettier 
Code was formated using prettier, though I cannot really see the effects 


# Summary 
If the resources are available, hope we could have live sessions where we can actually defend and present our codes, 
Overrall the Journey was fun, haven't made any friends yet, wish i will before i finish, it's a lonely programmer's world out here
